# PARKINSONS DISEASE PREDICTION USING ML

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms are also not that sound to be noticeable. Signs of stiffening, tremors, and slowing of movements may be signs of Parkinson’s disease. This project classifies the patient with disease from the healthy patients.

## Aim:

To classify patients with Parkinson's disease based on different features and use different machine lerning models to preict the presence of the disease in an individual.

SCOPE:

This will be helpful for the patients in the early detection of the disease.
